# 1. Scope of work
ProV shall deliver the IFS DW and ETL with the following features to meet the expectations of LATHAM.
1. IFS DW implementation and ETL delivery Features: 
- Establish Data Warehouse strategy and build DW Architecture with LATHAM.
- The DW solution will have multitier architecture Viz., Bronze (RAW+Refined Data), Silver (Cleansed & Refined Data) and Gold (Fine Data). All transformations of Data will be handled between Bronze and Silver tier. Profiling and mapping may need to consume data from other sources to fulfil tabular model requirement (as depicted in To-Be Diagram) at Azure Data Lake storage and Azure Data Pipeline stage.
- Replicate IFS tabular analysis model into Delta Lake into Medallion Architecture LATHAM format (with or without minor translations).
- Coding to extend IFS Analysis model or replicate IFS tabular model in Delta Lake to consume data from all sources (IFS DW as it is, other sources with or without mapping).
- Use Azure Purview and/or Azure analysis services.
- Consume Latham Legacy LDW Data for one time to the multitier Architecture.
2. All source applications are divided in 3 phases. A tentative list of applications in P1, P2 and P3 is as follows, Actual list should be done at requirement gathering phase,
- P1- LDW Legacy Data, IFS DW and S21
- P2- Thor, M1 and NetSuite
- P3- GP, Flat Files and Life Ray
- Develop Power BI and Excel reports (25~30 reports). Priority is for Finance and Sales Reports including rebates and commissions.
- Implement LATHAMâ€™s To-Be Architecture as per the diagram provided.
- Consume Legacy LDW historical Data to the new DW Solution using IFS Analysis model or by building similar parallel system for one time transfer.
- Integration Layer mapping using Boomi to map the data from each individual systems into the data lake for further processing. 
3. Conduct workshop with business to collect reporting requirements.
4. Prepare requirement specification and technical specification of reports.
5. Support UAT.
6. User training to core team members.
7. Deployment of reports.

ProV shall deploy Consultants working from PROV offices for implementation of the solution. The ProV Project team consists of the members required to perform development, testing, obtain sign-off and deployment aspects of the implementation. Following sections provide high level explanation about the scope of the Configurations, reports, integrations covered in this SOW for IFS DW and ETL project.
